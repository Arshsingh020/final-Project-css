            <h3>Heritage and tradition</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Lamborghini was founded by Ferruccio Lamborghini, an Italian
                entrepreneur, in 1963 with the goal of creating the perfect
                grand touring car. He was a successful tractor manufacturer, but
                he had always been passionate about cars, and he wanted to
                create a car that could compete with the best in the world.
              </li>
              <li>
                From the beginning, Lamborghini focused on innovation and
                excellence, using the latest technology and the best materials
                to create cars that were not only beautiful but also incredibly
                powerful and fast. Lamborghini's first car, the 350 GT, was a
                huge success, and it was quickly followed by the Miura, which is
                still considered one of the greatest sports cars ever made.
              </li>
              <li>
                Over the years, Lamborghini has continued to innovate, pushing
                the boundaries of what's possible with each new car. Today,
                Lamborghini is still known for its passion and excellence, and
                its cars are some of the most sought-after in the world.
